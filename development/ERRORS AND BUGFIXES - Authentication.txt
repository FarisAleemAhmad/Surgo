ERRORS AND BUGFIXES - Authentication


---BugFixes---
1) when an email has been signed up with, reusing that email to sign up causes the navigation to lead to homepage, and a popup saying signUp successful, please log in to occur. there's two subcases within this, 
a) if the email was confirmed before resigning up, another email confirmation isnt set
b) but if the email wasnt confirmed beforehand, another email is sent to the user 
if both signups use the same email but different passwords, the first password is always used
2) i can press the back button on my edge after i login to go back to my navigation page, that shouldn't be possible. i dont know if it's because im using edge to use the app and it wont occur in the mobile app.

---Refinements---
1 ) the snackbar errors have a very outstanding and awkward / blaring aesthetic - it is a full white bar at the bottom clashing against the app's relative design.

2) the errors in the snackbar are not dealt with. they often occur in the raw format that they are produced in, for example - DIOEXCEPTION STATUS CODE 400 etc. i want it to be more user friendly/

here are the errors i noted down that are common to occur
a) invalid credentials (when logging in)
b) email unconfirmed when trying to log in but after signing up
